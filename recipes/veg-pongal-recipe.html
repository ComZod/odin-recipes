    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Pongal is a delicious and versatile South Indian dish, traditionally made with rice and lentils, often moong dal,
        and seasoned with spices like black pepper, cumin, and ginger. It's a celebratory dish, especially during the
        Pongal festival, where it's offered as a thanksgiving to the Sun God for a bountiful harvest. Pongal can be
        savory or sweet, with the sweet version, Sakkarai Pongal, incorporating jaggery, cardamom, and ghee. It's a
        simple yet comforting dish, often enjoyed with coconut chutney and sambar. </p>



    <p>Savory Pongal is characterized by its spiced, aromatic flavor from the tempering of black pepper, cumin, and
        ginger. Sweet Pongal offers a comforting sweetness from jaggery and cardamom, often enhanced with ghee and nuts.
