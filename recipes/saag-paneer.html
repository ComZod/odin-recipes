    <h2 class="desc">Description:</h2>
    <p>Saag paneer is a hearty and flavorful Indian dish consisting of soft paneer cheese cubes served in a creamy,
        spicy curry made primarily with leafy greens. The word "saag" refers to the leafy greens, and it can be made
        with a mix of greens like spinach, mustard greens, kale, fenugreek, and other varieties.</p>

    <p>Saag paneer is particularly popular in North India, especially the Punjab region, where it's a traditional dish
        enjoyed during the colder months. The Punjabi version often uses mustard greens (sarson) as the primary green,
        combined with other greens like spinach and bathua (chenopodium).</p>

    <p>This popular vegetarian meal is often served with naan bread, roti, or rice. It is known for its blend of
        flavors, which can be peppery or earthy depending on the greens used, and the addition of spices such as garlic,
        cumin, turmeric, and chili powder. Some recipes also incorporate cream or yogurt for a smoother, richer texture.

    <h2 class="ingr">Ingredients:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon turmeric</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons plus 1 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>12 ounces paneer, (Indian cheese, either store-bought or made from my recipe, recipe follows), cut into
            1-inch cubes</li>
        <li>1 (16-ounce package) frozen chopped spinach</li>
        <li>1 medium white onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 (1-inch thumb) ginger, peeled and minced (about 1 tablespoon)</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 large green serrano chile, finely chopped (seeds removed if you don't like it spicy!)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon store-bought or homemade garam masala, recipe follows</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1/2 cup plain yogurt, stirred until smooth</li>

    </ul>

    <h2 class="steps">Steps:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the turmeric, cayenne, 1 teaspoon salt and 3 tablespoons oil. Gently, drop
            in
            the cubes of paneer and gently toss, taking care not to break the cubes if you're using the homemade kind.
            Let
            the cubes marinate while you get the rest of your ingredients together and prepped.</li>

        <li>Thaw the spinach in the microwave in a microwave-safe dish, 5 minutes on high, then puree in a food
            processor
            until smooth. Alternatively, you can chop it up very finely with your knife.</li>

        <li>Place a large nonstick skillet over medium heat, and add the paneer as the pan warms. In a couple of minutes
            give the pan a toss; each piece of paneer should be browned on one side. Fry another minute or so, and then
            remove the paneer from the pan onto a plate.</li>

        <li>Add the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons oil to the pan. Add the onions, ginger, garlic and chile. Now here's the
            important part: saute the mixture until it's evenly toffee-coloured, which should take about 15 minutes.
            Don't
            skip this step - this is the foundation of the dish! If you feel like the mixture is drying out and burning,
            add
            a couple of tablespoons of water.</li>

        <li>Add the garam masala, coriander and cumin. If you haven't already, sprinkle a little water to keep the
            spices
            from burning. Cook, stirring often, until the raw scent of the spices cook out, and it all smells a bit more
            melodious, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>

        <li>Add the spinach and stir well, incorporating the spiced onion mixture into the spinach. Add a little salt
            and
            1/2 cup of water, stir, and cook about 5 minutes with the lid off.</li>

        <li>Turn the heat off. Add the yogurt, a little at a time to keep it from curdling. Once the yogurt is well
            mixed
            into the spinach, add the paneer. Turn the heat back on, cover and cook until everything is warmed through,
            about 5 minutes. Serve.</li>

    </ol>
