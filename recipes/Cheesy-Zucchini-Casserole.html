    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>A Cheesy Zucchini Casserole is a savory and flavorful dish that utilizes fresh zucchini, often abundant during
        the summer months. It’s known for its comforting qualities and ability to be enjoyed as a main course or a
        delicious side dish.</p>

    <p>Here's a breakdown of the typical characteristics of a cheesy zucchini casserole:
    </p>


    <p><strong>Key Ingredients:</strong> Fresh zucchini (often grated or sliced), cheese (like cheddar, mozzarella,
        Parmesan, or a
        combination), eggs (for binding), and seasonings (such as garlic, onion, herbs like oregano, thyme, and
        basil). Some recipes include breadcrumbs or panko for topping or incorporating within the casserole.</p>

    <p><strong>Texture:</strong> It typically features tender, yet not mushy, zucchini pieces enveloped in a
        creamy, cheesy base.
        Many recipes incorporate a crispy topping, often made with breadcrumbs or panko, for added texture contrast.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Flavor Profile:</strong> The casserole is characterized by its savory and cheesy taste, often
        enhanced by the addition of herbs and spices. The mild sweetness of the zucchini complements the richness of
        the cheese and the earthy notes of the seasonings.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Preparation:</strong> While there are variations, a common method involves preparing the zucchini
        (grating or slicing
        and often salting to remove excess moisture), mixing it with the other ingredients, and baking it until
        bubbly and golden brown. Some recipes may suggest briefly cooking the zucchini and/or onions and garlic
        before baking to enhance the flavors.</p>
